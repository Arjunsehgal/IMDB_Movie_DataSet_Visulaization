# IMDb-movie-dataset-project

# Problem statement:

Based on the massive movie information, it would be interesting to understand what are the important factors that make a movie more successful than others. So, we would like to analyze what kind of movies are grossing more and getting higher profits. We also want to show the results of this analysis by visualizing the outcome. In this project, we take gross as a response variable and focus on operating predictions by analyzing the rest of variables in the IMDB 5000 movie data.



# Dataset Description:

The dataset is from kaggle. It contains 28 variables for 5043 rows. There are 2398 unique director names. 4917 unique movie titles. We are trying to predict gross while the other attributes are predictors.
